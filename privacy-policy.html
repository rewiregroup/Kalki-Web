    Welcome to our privacy and policy page for our ERP platform for schools. At Rewire Group, we take the privacy and security of our users very seriously. We understand that schools entrust us with sensitive information about their students, teachers, and staff, and it is our responsibility to protect that information.

This page outlines our privacy and policy practices for our ERP platform, including how we collect, use, and share personal information. We encourage you to read this page carefully and contact us if you have any questions or concerns.

    <h2>Collection of personal information:</h2>

We collect personal information from our users when they sign up for our ERP platform or use certain features of the platform.

We use the personal information we collect from our users to provide them with access to the platform and its features, to communicate with them about their account or the platform, and to improve the platform based on user feedback.

    <h2>Sharing of personal information:</h2>

We do not sell or share personal information with third parties for their own marketing purposes. We may share personal information with third parties who provide services on our behalf, such as hosting or analytics services.
